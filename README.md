This API is developed in Spring Boot and will be used for a budget control react app, at this moment all the API Contract works but login and permissions is not implemented yet.

The database is a Docker PostgreSQL so feel free to try yourself, all you will be needing to use this API is inside the Contract, it's a API RESTfull, so no confusing URI or methods.
